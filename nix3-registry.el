;;; Commentary:

;; This compatibility entry point loads both the registry data layer and its
;; flake display command.  Internal libraries depend on `nix3-registry-core'
;; instead, keeping the dependency flow one-way.

;;; Code:

(require 'nix3-registry-core)
(require 'nix3-registry-list)

(provide 'nix3-registry)
;;; nix3-registry.el ends here
