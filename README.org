* nix3.el
=nix3.el= is an experimental Emacs interface to experimental commands of Nix.
Its goal is to enable the user to easily work across multiple projects.
It is also intended to provide a common infrastructure for [[https://github.com/emacs-twist/twist.el][twist.el]].

A typical use case is a multi-repository project that consists of a main application that is a flake and its dependencies in separate repositories which may be or may not be flakes.
You clone the source of a dependency, fix a bug or add a feature, and rebuild the main application.
=nix3.el= should accelerate this cycle by supporting both local and remote flakes.
** Usage
- =nix3-flake-show= command displays information on a flake on filesystem.
- =nix3-flake-show-url= command displays information on a remote flake.
- =nix3-flake-init= command picks up a template from the registry and run =nix flake init= command.
